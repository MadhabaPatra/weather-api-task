# Weather API - Backend Task

## Overview

This API gives you the current weather based on the user's IP address. It does this by integrating two key external services:

1. **Geolocation API**: Finds the user's location based on their IP.
2. **Weather API**: Gets the weather data for that location.

The API is designed with best practices in

1. Error handling
2. Rate limiting,
3. Caching
4. Modular file structure(Three layer architecture)
5. Documentation (Followed Standard: https://jsdoc.app)
6. Testing friendly

## Key Features

- **Endpoint**: `GET /weather-by-ip`

  - Optionally accepts an `ip` query parameter.
  - If the `ip` isnâ€™t provided, it automatically grabs the IP from the request.

- **Response Example**:

  ```json
  {
    "ip": "123.123.123.123",
    "location": {
      "city": "Pune",
      "country": "India"
    },
    "weather": {
      "temperature": 30.5,
      "humidity": 60,
      "description": "clear sky"
    }
  }
  ```

- **Rate Limiting**: You can make up to 5 requests per minute for each IP.

- **Caching**: Weather data for a city is cached for 10 minutes to reduce API calls.

- **Logging**: The API logs activity with timestamps and log levels, so you can always track what's going on.

- **Security**: We follow standard security practices, such as input validation and rate limiting.

## Installation Instructions

1. **Clone the repo**:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd weather-api-task
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up your environment variables**:
   Rename a `.env.example` file in the root directory with your keys for the APIs:

4. **Start the development**:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Using the API

### Endpoint: `GET /weather-by-ip`

- **Query Parameters**:

  - `ip` (optional): You can specify an IP address, or leave it empty to use the client's IP.

- **Example**:
  ```bash
  curl "http://localhost:8080/weather-by-ip?ip=123.123.123.123"
  ```

### Sample Response:

```json
{
  "ip": "123.123.123.123",
  "location": {
    "city": "Pune",
    "country": "India"
  },
  "weather": {
    "temperature": 30.5,
    "humidity": 60,
    "description": "clear sky"
  }
}
```

## Development Notes

### Scripts

- `npm run start`: This will start the server for you.
- `npm run test`: Run the tests to make sure everything is working.
